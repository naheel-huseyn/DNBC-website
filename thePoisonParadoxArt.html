    <p>'Spider girl'
While the quickest recorded death from a Sydney funnel-web spider was a toddler at 13 minutes, the average is closer to 76 minutes - and first aid gives you an even better chance of surviving.

So successful is the antivenom programme here at the Australian Reptile Park that nobody has been killed by one since it started in 1981.

The scheme relies, however, on members of the public either catching the spiders or collecting their egg sacs.

In a van plastered with a giant crocodile sticker, each week Ms Teni's team drives all over Australia's most famous city, picking up Sydney funnel-webs that have been handed in at drop-off points such as local veterinary practices.
There are two reasons why these spiders are so dangerous, she explains: not only is their venom extremely potent, but they also live exclusively in a densely populated region where they're more likely to encounter humans.

Handyman Charlie Simpson is one such person. He moved into his first home with his girlfriend a few months ago, and the keen gardener has already found two Sydney funnel-webs. He took the second spider to the vet, where Ms Teni picked it up shortly after.

"I had gloves on at the time, but realistically I should have had leather gloves on because their fangs are so big and strong," the 26-year-old says.

"I [just thought] I had better catch it because I kept getting told you're meant to take them back to be milked, because it's so critical."

"This is curing my fear of spiders," he jokes.

As Ms Teni offloads one arachnid that was delivered to her in a Vegemite jar, she stresses her team isn't telling Australians to go looking for the spiders and "throw themselves into danger".

Rather, they're asking that if someone comes across one, they safely capture it rather than kill it.

"Saying that this is the world's most deadly spider and then [asking the public to] catch it and bring it to us does sound counter-intuitive," she says.

"[But] that spider there now, thanks to Charlie, willâ€¦ effectively save someone's life."</p>
