    <p>Dortmund snatch last Champions League spot with win over Kiel in season finale
        DORTMUND, Germany, May 17 (Reuters) - Borussia Dortmund cruised past relegated Holstein Kiel 3-0 on Saturday to finish fourth and snatch the last Champions League spot for next season, in the best comeback of the last seven matchdays in Bundesliga history.
Niko Kovac's Dortmund won six of their last seven matches to climb from 10th to fourth in the standings and finish on 57 points, two ahead of Freiburg who lost 3-1 at home to third-placed Eintracht Frankfurt.
Kovac had taken over in February with the team in 11th place after the departure of Nuri Sahin following a disappointing first half to the season.
No other Bundesliga team have managed such a comeback in the last seven matchdays.
"We are all happy but there is no reason to celebrate," Kovac told a press conference. "I am happy and we are all happy to have pushed this through, to have taken that last step which is sometime difficult to take.
Missing out on the lucrative Champions League would have been both a sporting and financial setback for the publicly-traded club.
"For a long time we were just passengers and on the final matchday we were in the driving seat and did it just in time," said the Croat.
"I did my job but I want to underline that you cannot achieve anything in football alone."
CLUB WORLD CUP NEXT
Dortmund players will now go into a two-week break before returning in early June ahead of the Club World Cup in the United States."
