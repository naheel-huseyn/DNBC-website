We have deep relations with both sides, says British foreign secretary
LONDON: British Foreign Secretary David Lammy has said that the ceasefire between India and Pakistan is hugely welcome but it remains fragile, and his government is working with international partners to sustain the ceasefire agreement.

Lammy is currently in Pakistan to meet the Pakistani leadership to hold talks on various issues, including the recent fight between India and Pakistan.

He spoke to Geo News during a phone call from Islamabad, where he has already met Pakistan government representatives.

When asked by Geo News about India’s arrogant attacks on Pakistan without producing any evidence of Islamabad's involvement in the Pahalgam attacks, the foreign secretary said: "We made it clear that terrorist attacks in Pahalgam were horrific. Our thoughts are with the loved ones of those who suffered in these attacks. The UK government has been condemning terrorism in all forms, in no uncertain terms. I offered my condolences.”

The UK foreign secretary said he had discussed the issue of terrorism in Pakistan. He said: “Here in Pakistan, we have discussed this. Pakistan too has been subject to terrorism in the recent past. The focus has been to de-escalate and build a horizon where there is confidence between the two countries. We have to bear down on terrorist threats and ensure that militancy doesn’t go on.”

Answering a question, he said the UK was friends with both countries. "We have deep relations with both sides. We are working with our other partners."
MP Lammy said: “I wouldn’t expect India to share its matters of national security with me. What we are here to do is to ensure support to friends to maintain an enduring ceasefire whilst recognising that terrorism has to be dealt with. There are concerns that there are groups here engaged in causing harm. This all began with the horrendous terrorism threat.”

What we are here to do is to ensure support to friends to maintain an enduring ceasefire whilst recognising that terrorism has to be dealt with. There are concerns that there are groups here engaged in causing harm. This all began with the horrendous terrorism threat.”

He said the leadership of both countries was “impressive” and showed statesmanship in de-escalating tensions and agreeing to a ceasefire.

He said: "It’s important that this ceasefire holds. It's fragile. My visit is about this and other matters. I am the first foreign secretary to come here in four years. I will be speaking about important links and friendships between our two countries, trade and cultural exchange and the support we give to Pakistan on many issues."

Lammy recognised that the India-Pakistan tensions had a direct bearing on the Indian and Pakistani communities in the UK. However, he appreciated the role of these communities and the local governments in dealing with it.

He said: “There was anxiety and concerns but we have communities living side by side in the UK. We have seen troubling images coming to the UK from India and Pakistan but these communities acted responsibly.”

He revealed that the concerns were so serious with British-Pakistanis that the British High Commission staff received over 2,000 calls “from people who were worried about Pakistan-India tensions. Staff in India and Pakistan have been providing support to the Britons by arranging more flights.
