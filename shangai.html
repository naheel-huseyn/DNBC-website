        <p>Shanghai’s business environment in May 2025 is thriving, driven by strategic investments, strong tech sector performance, and policy measures aimed at enhancing global competitiveness. The city reported 5.1% GDP growth in Q1, fueled largely by information technology and finance, with notable profit surges from companies like Pinduoduo and Xiaohongshu. U.S. chip giant Nvidia is setting up a new R&D center in Shanghai to better serve Chinese markets while navigating U.S. export restrictions, supported by local government incentives. Additionally, Shanghai has announced $32.7 billion in investments for infrastructure and urban renewal projects, backed by innovative financing methods. The city’s May 5 Shopping Festival promotes domestic consumption and targets the “silver economy” — services for elderly citizens — while also supporting foreign trade firms. Shanghai is also gearing up to host the 2025 Global Investment Promotion Conference, welcoming over 500 companies and reinforcing its position as a key global investment hub. Overall, Shanghai stands out as a dynamic and resilient economic center focused on innovation, international collaboration, and sustainable growth.</p>
