        <p class="card-text mx-4 px-5">A dinosaur sculpture in New Zealand has sparked lively debate among locals and online observers, with many questioning its scientific accuracy and artistic design. Nicknamed "Jurassic Snark" by critics, the sculpture—intended to represent a dinosaur from the Mesozoic era—has drawn both amusement and criticism for its exaggerated features and cartoonish appearance. While some appreciate it as a fun and eye-catching piece of public art, others argue that it misrepresents prehistoric creatures and sends the wrong message about paleontology.</p>

The blockade had severely worsened the already dire humanitarian situation, leaving over two million people with limited access to food, water, and medical supplies. While the entry of aid was welcomed by humanitarian groups, the United Nations described the move as merely a “drop in the ocean,” emphasizing that the scale of suffering in Gaza requires a far greater and sustained flow of assistance.</p>

Marketed as a fiber-rich health supplement, the gummies were found to contain only 16mg of fiber per piece—far less than the advertised 200mg—and relied heavily on sorbitol, a laxative, to produce digestive effects. Tien co-owned the product and earned approximately $270,000 from its sales, despite knowing about its misleading claims.</p>

        <p class="card-text mx-4 px-5">In a tragic incident in central Mexico, seven young men, including minors, were fatally shot during a church-organized festivity in the village of San Bartolo de Berrios, Guanajuato state. The attack occurred around 2:00 a.m. on Monday, as the victims lingered in the central square after the event. Gunmen arrived in a van, opened fire indiscriminately, and left behind banners associated with the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel, indicating the attack's possible cartel-related motive.</p>

        <p class="card-text mx-4 px-5">The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, has embarked on a comprehensive digitisation project to make its extensive Fungarium collection accessible to researchers and the public worldwide. Among the fascinating specimens being archived is Gibellula attenboroughii, a parasitic fungus that infects spiders, manipulating their behaviour before killing them to facilitate spore dispersal. This species, first observed in Northern Ireland and named in honour of Sir David Attenborough, exemplifies the complex interactions between fungi and their hosts.</p>

        <p class="card-text mx-4 px-5">The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) has filed an unfair labor practice charge against Epic Games' subsidiary, Llama Productions, over the use of an AI-generated Darth Vader voice in Fortnite. While the late James Earl Jones' estate granted permission for his voice to be digitally replicated, SAG-AFTRA contends that the implementation of this AI voice in the game was done without prior consultation or negotiation with the union.</p>
