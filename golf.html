    <p>Double down! Vegas leads PGA Championship, Scheffler three back
        CHARLOTTE, North Carolina, May 16 (Reuters) - Venezuela's Jhonattan Vegas led after the second round of the PGA Championship on Friday at Quail Hollow Club, where Scottie Scheffler added star power to the leaderboard and Max Homa fired the low round of the day to roar into contention.
Vegas, who began the day leading a major for the first time, carded a one-under 70 to reach eight under on the week, leaving him two shots clear of France's Matthieu Pavon (65), England's Matt Fitzpatrick (68) and South Korea's Kim Si-woo (64).
"You never know when things are going to turn your way," said Vegas, the world number 70. "I'm enjoying the process, and just got to keep going."
The 40-year-old Vegas had a four-shot lead when he reached the par-four closing hole but ran into trouble after he sent his approach from the middle of the fairway into a greenside bunker.
What looked like a routine up-and-down turned into a double-bogey finish as Vegas mis-hit his third shot and watched it roll off the green from where he chipped it close and then missed a three-foot bogey putt.
After an opening round in which many top players struggled, world number one Scheffler found his groove late in the round and did his part to give the leaderboard a familiar look.
Scheffler followed his lone bogey of the day with back-to-back birdies at 14 and 15, and had a glorious chance to get within two after a stellar tee shot at the par-three 17th but his putt caught the edge of the cup.
"As the round went on, my swing continued to get better, and I was able to hit some key shots down the stretch to give myself some opportunities," Scheffler said. "Looking forward to the weekend."
MCILROY CATCHES BREAK
Homa, who won his maiden PGA Tour title at Quail Hollow in 2019, fired a sparkling 64 that left him in a two-way share of fifth place with Scheffler.
Homa wasted no time making his move as he reached the turn with a six-under-par 30 that marked the best nine-hole score of his majors career and included a near ace at the par-four 14th where he tapped in for eagle.
"That was one of the rare occasions in golf where as the further you walk up to the green, the closer it got," Homa said. "Very thankful to only have a little 1 1/2-footer for eagle."
