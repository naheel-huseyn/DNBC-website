    <p>HBL PSL 2025: Action resumes after nine-day hiatus with playoffs race wide open
Karachi, currently second on the table with 10 points from nine games, require at least one more win to seal their playoff berth.
ISLAMABAD: The HBL Pakistan Super League (PSL) is set to resume on Saturday after a nine-day hiatus with the league entering a decisive phase as five teams remain in the hunt for the four playoff spots.

The league was postponed due to cross-border tensions taking place between Pakistan and India between the early hours of May 7 and May 10, when the escalation seized after a ceasefire agreement.
The disruption had seen overseas players fly out of the country before the Pakistan Cricket Board’s decision to resume the tournament got the six franchises scrambling to get their squads back together.

With only eight matches left in the league stage of the 34-match season, the battle for qualification has intensified, with last year’s finalists Multan Sultans already knocked out of contention after losing eight of their nine matches.

The Rawalpindi leg will host the final round of league matches before the playoffs shift to Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, scheduled from May 21 to 25, with May 24 marked as a rest day.

Saturday’s clash between David Warner-led Karachi Kings and Babar Azam’s Peshawar Zalmi will mark the resumption of the tournament and set the tone for a high-stakes final week.
