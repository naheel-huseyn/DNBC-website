        <h2>Business</h2>
        <p>Tokyo’s business climate in May 2025 reflects a resilient and evolving economy marked by major corporate developments, booming tourism, and proactive policy strategies. SoftBank has returned to profitability with a ¥1.15 trillion gain, driven by strategic AI investments and a $6.5 billion acquisition plan of U.S. chipmaker Ampere. Meanwhile, Nissan is undergoing a dramatic restructuring, slashing 15% of its workforce following a ¥670.9 billion annual loss. Tourism is at an all-time high with nearly 37 million visitors in 2024, boosting hotel revenues and prompting large-scale real estate deals, including Blackstone’s ¥400 billion acquisition in central Tokyo. However, challenges like inflation, labor shortages, and regulatory pressures persist. The Bank of Japan is holding interest rates steady but remains open to hikes amid inflationary trends. Trade relations with the U.S. are under scrutiny as Japan considers expanding subsidies for Tesla’s EV infrastructure. Tokyo is also rapidly positioning itself as a global startup hub through initiatives like SusHi Tech Tokyo, reinforcing its commitment to innovation and global investment.</p>
